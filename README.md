### Hi, I'm Tebe

MSc student in Artificial Intelligence, Bachelor in Mathematics for AI at Bocconi University.

**Main interests** 

My recent work focuses on the intersection of ML and simulation, with some quantified-self tooling here and there.

- Working on: applied ML, personal data analysis, small productivity tools
- Interests: geometric / graph-based deep learning, dynamical systems, tooling for better thinking
- Mostly using: Python, Go, Rust, Jupyter. VScode + Arch Linux with KDE

**Selected projects**

- 🐦 [BirdCLEF 2025](https://github.com/quercia-dev/birdclef2025): audio pipeline + CNNs for bird call recognition on highly imbalanced data
- 🎯 [Pursuit Curves](https://github.com/quercia-dev/pursuit-curves): simulations of predator–prey differential games with Numba-accelerated dynamics
- 📊 [Personal Analysis](https://github.com/tebe-nigrelli/personal-analysis): self-tracking pipeline from Emacs logs to pandas notebooks
- 📚 [BAI Notes](https://github.com/tebe-nigrelli/BAI-notes): (somewhat) curated notes for Bocconi’s Bachelor in AI
- ⌨️ [Doom Emacs Config](https://github.com/tebe-nigrelli/doomemacs-config): my old Emacs setup for writing, coding and analysis
